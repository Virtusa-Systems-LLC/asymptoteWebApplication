There are two modes for running this application:

1. Running only the front-end part of the application 
   ==================================================
    This mode is mainly used for development of the GUI aspects to 
    see if any change made to CSS or Javascript is working as it is 
    meant to be. While running the application in this mode, no 
    communication can be made to the server. The application will be 
    automatically launched on a localhost service.

    To run the application under this mode, use

        npm start


2. Running the full application 
   ============================
    To run the full application, it must first be built with

        npm run build

    If the build is successful, launch the server with
    
        node server.js

    The application can then be accessed on

        http://localhost:3000
